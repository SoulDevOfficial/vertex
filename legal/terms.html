    <p>
<strong>1. Acceptance of Terms</strong><br>
By accessing or using the Discord bot, associated applications, websites, and services (the “Service”), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree, you may not use the Service. This full document goes into effect 22/12/2025.<br><br>

<strong>2. Eligibility</strong><br>
You must comply with Discord’s Terms of Service and be legally permitted to use the Service. Use by anyone barred under applicable law is prohibited.<br><br>

<strong>3. Description of Service</strong><br>
The Service provides automated Discord functionality, including optional Premium features. Features may change, be limited, or be discontinued at any time without notice.<br><br>

<strong>4. User Responsibilities</strong><br>
You agree not to misuse the Service, attempt to exploit features, bypass limitations, or use the Service in violation of any law or Discord policy. You are responsible for all activity performed using your account or server.<br><br>

<strong>5. Premium and Payments</strong><br>
Premium features are digital services. All payments (excluding first time purchase refund) are final unless otherwise required by law. Failure to pay, chargebacks, or payment disputes may result in suspension or termination without refund.<br><br>

<strong>6. Data and Privacy</strong><br>
Use of the Service is also governed by our Privacy Policy. By using the Service, you consent to data collection and use as described therein.<br><br>

<strong>7. Service Availability</strong><br>
The Service is provided “as is” and “as available.” We do not guarantee uptime, availability, or error-free operation and are not liable for service interruptions or data loss.<br><br>

<strong>8. Termination</strong><br>
We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access to the Service at any time, with or without notice, for violations of these Terms or for any reason deemed necessary to protect the Service.<br><br>

<strong>9. Limitation of Liability</strong><br>
To the maximum extent permitted by law, the bot staff and service operators shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages arising from use of or inability to use the Service.<br><br>

<strong>10. Dispute Resolution</strong><br>
Before initiating any legal action, you agree to first contact bot staff and attempt to resolve the dispute informally and in good faith through the official support channels. Legal action may not be pursued unless a reasonable resolution attempt has been made.<br><br>

<strong>11. Governing Law</strong><br>
These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with applicable laws of the service operator’s jurisdiction, without regard to conflict of law principles.<br><br>

<strong>12. Changes to Terms</strong><br>
We may update these Terms at any time. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.<br><br>

<strong>13. Contact</strong><br>
For questions, disputes, or legal notices, you must contact bot staff through the official website or Discord support server before pursuing any other action.<br><br>
