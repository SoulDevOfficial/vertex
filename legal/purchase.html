    <p>
      The following is the purchase policy for premium plans for the bot "Vertex". This policy effects all displayed or hidden plans unless said otherwise. This policy goes into effect 22/16/2025. Any official purchases confirm that the buyer has agreed to the following terms.<br><br>

      1. Premium plans are a digital, non-tangible service delivered electronically upon successful payment. It is not to be bought otherwise or by other means other than the means provided by Vertex staff or the official site. (https://souldevofficial.github.io/vertex/premium/)<br><br> 

      2. Prices are listed on our purchase page and may change at any time. Taxes, if applicable, are added at checkout. Billing may be one-time or recurring, as specified at purchase.<br><br>

      3. Payments are processed through a third-party provider. We do not store payment details other than what is needed for Vertex to operate.<br><br>

      4. Premium features are not activated automatically after payment confirmation. Activation must be done by the buyer on our official server (https://discord.gg/SF4pQxtfSB) Activation time may vary due to processing delays, unavailibility, incapability.<br><br>

      5. All sales are final except for first time buyers which do gain a seven day refund availibility. Other than first time purchase, refunds are not provided once any premium plan purchase is granted, except where required by law.<br><br>

      6. Unauthorized chargebacks may result in suspension or termination of Premium access and associated accounts.<br><br>

      7. For recurring plans, users are responsible for managing cancellations before the renewal date. No partial refunds are issued for unused time unless otherise granted by authorized premium managers on the Vertex team.<br><br>

      8. Premium features are provided “as is” and may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time without liability.<br><br>

      9. Violation of terms, abuse of Premium features, or attempts to exploit the service may result in termination without refund.<br><br>

      10. This policy may be updated at any time. Continued use of Premium constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.<br><br>

      11. For purchase-related issues, contact support through proper channels found in our Discord support server. (https://discord.gg/SF4pQxtfSB)<br><br>
